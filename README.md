# 📞 Call Center Dashboard (Power BI Project)

## 🧩 Project Summary
This Power BI project analyzes call center performance to uncover trends, monitor key service metrics, and improve operational efficiency.  
The dashboard provides a 360° view of how efficiently customer inquiries are handled across various channels, states, and sentiments — enabling data-driven decisions for better customer experience and resource planning.  

## 💡 Problem Statement
Call centers handle thousands of customer interactions daily. Without proper analytics, it becomes challenging to identify:
- When the call volume peaks
- Which channels customers prefer
- How quickly agents respond
- What factors impact customer satisfaction
  
To solve this, a dynamic Power BI dashboard was created to visualize performance metrics in real time.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure overall call activity and duration trends
- Evaluate response time to maintain SLA standards 
- Analyze call distribution by channel, geography, and sentiment
- Provide leadership with actionable insights for staffing and training decisions

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
The dashboard consists of two main views:  

### **1️⃣ Home View**
A summary page highlighting the most important metrics:  
- **Total Calls:** 33K
- **Total Duration:** 13.7K hrs (824K mins)
- **Average Call Duration:** 25 mins
- **Response Time:** 75.26%  

### **2️⃣ Grid View**
An interactive data table allowing users to:
- Filter data by date, city, and channel  
- Explore detailed call records  
- Export filtered results for reporting

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Implementation
